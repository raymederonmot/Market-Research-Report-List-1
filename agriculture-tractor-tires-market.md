<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agriculture Tractor Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias-ply Tires</li><li>Radial-ply Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agriculture tractor tires market is primarily segmented into two types: bias-ply and radial-ply tires. Bias-ply tires, characterized by crisscrossing layers of fabric, offer durability and flexibility but typically provide less traction and stability than radial-ply tires. Radial-ply tires, featuring a more modern design with layers arranged radially, offer superior grip, improved fuel efficiency, and better ride comfort. The choice between these tire types depends on factors like terrain, load capacity, and operational requirements.</p></p>
